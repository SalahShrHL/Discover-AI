        <h4>2. Applications Of Artificial Intelligence in Education</h4>
        <div class="element">
            <p>Although the education sector is the one most influenced by humans, Artificial Intelligence has slowly begun to seep its roots in the education sector as well. Even in the education sector, this slow transition of Artificial Intelligence has
                helped increase productivity among faculties and helped them concentrate more on students than office or administration work. Some of these applications in this sector include:</p>
            <h5>Administrative Tasks Automated to Aid Educators </h5>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence can help educators with non-educational tasks like task-related duties like facilitating and automating personalized messages to students, back-office tasks like grading paperwork, arranging and facilitating parent
                and guardian interactions, routine issue feedback facilitating, managing enrollment, courses, and HR-related topics. </p>
            <h5>Creating Smart Content</h5>
            <p>Digitization of content like video lectures, conferences, and text book guides can be made using Artificial Intelligence. We can apply different interfaces like animations and learning content through customization for students from different
                grades. Artificial Intelligence helps create a rich learning experience by generating and providing audio and video summaries and integral lesson plans.</p>

            <h5>Voice Assistants</h5>
            <p>Without even the direct involvement of the lecturer or the teacher, a student can access extra learning material or assistance through Voice Assistants. Through this, printing costs of temporary handbooks and also provide answers to very common
                questions easily.</p>

            <h5>Personalized Learning</h5>
            <p>Using AI technology, hyper-personalization techniques can be used to monitor studentsâ€™ data thoroughly, and habits, lesson plans, reminders, study guides, flash notes, frequency or revision, etc., can be easily generated.</p>

            <h5>Spam Filters</h5>
            <p>The email that we use in our day-to-day lives has AI that filters out spam emails sending them to spam or trash folders, letting us see the filtered content only. The popular email provider, Gmail, has managed to reach a filtration capacity
                of approximately 99.9%.</p>

            <h5>Facial Recognition</h5>
            <p>Our favorite devices like our phones, laptops, and PCs use facial recognition techniques by using face filters to detect and identify in order to provide secure access. Apart from personal usage, facial recognition is a widely used Artificial
                Intelligence application even in high security-related areas in several industries.</p>

            <h5>Recommendation System</h5>
            <p>Various platforms that we use in our daily lives like e-commerce, entertainment websites, social media, video sharing platforms, like youtube, etc., all use the recommendation system to get user data and provide customized recommendations
                to users to increase engagement. This is a very widely used Artificial Intelligence application in almost all industries.</p>
